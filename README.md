# WordTutor

A vocabulary learning application.

## Overview

WordTutor is a simple desktop application designed to help you learn new vocabulary. Built with Java and Swing, it provides a convenient way to study word sets directly from your system tray.

**Key Features:**

* Select learning sets from the system tray for quick access.
* Create custom learning sets by importing data from existing files, such as CSV files.

## Installation

As this is a standalone executable (`WordTutor.exe`), no formal installation is required. Simply download the file and run it. The application will likely place an icon in your system tray.

## Usage

1.  **Launch the Application:** Double-click `WordTutor.exe`. The application should minimize to your system tray (usually located at the bottom right of your screen on Windows).
2.  **Select Learning Set:** Right-click on the WordTutor icon in the system tray. A menu should appear, allowing you to select from pre-defined learning sets.
3.  **Create Learning Set (Optional):** The menu in the system tray might also have an option to create a new learning set. This could involve:
    * Selecting an existing CSV file containing your vocabulary words and their definitions. The application will then parse this file to create a new learning set.
    * Potentially allowing you to manually input words and definitions through a separate interface.

Further instructions on how to study the vocabulary words will depend on the specific features of the application (e.g., flashcards, quizzes).

Remember to adjust the "Usage" section with more specific details about how users interact with the learning sets and any other features your application might have. You might also want to mention the expected format of the CSV files if that's the primary way to create custom sets.
